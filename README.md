# Redneck weather forecast

This is my redneck forecast.  It is powered by the NWS api.

## Program flow

The first function will get the forecast url and call the second function passing in the url.  The second function will output the 7 day (14 period) forecast for the area.





### Leasons learned

The file index1.js was my first attempt.  Did not have the expected result becasue I did not nest functions correctly.
